# Brest-Cancer-Gene-Expression-Profiles-Analysis

Led a comprehensive bioinformatics data analysis project integrating SQL, R, and Tableau to assess the impact of genetic mutations on breast cancer patient survival outcomes.
Developed and implemented survival analysis techniques, including Kaplan-Meier estimations and log-rank tests, to compare survival rates between patient groups with different mutation profiles.

Utilized SQL for efficient data extraction and management, performed detailed statistical analysis in R, and created interactive dashboards in Tableau for clear and actionable data visualization.

Analyzed mutation data to identify significant survival differences, contributing to deeper insights into mutation-driven cancer progression.


## Overview
This project integrates SQL, R, and Tableau to analyze and visualize patient data related to breast cancer mutations.

## Setup

### Database
1. Run the SQL scripts to create the database and tables.
2. Populate the tables with your data.

### R Analysis
1. Use the R scripts  to perform survival analysis and mutation impact analysis.
2. Ensure that you have all necessary R packages installed.

### Tableau Visualization
1. Open the Tableau workbook.
2. Connect it to your SQL database and refresh the data.

## Results
- The project includes Kaplan-Meier survival curves, mutation frequency analysis, and more.
